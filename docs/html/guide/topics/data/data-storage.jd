<p>Android provides several options for you to save persistent application data. The solution you
choose depends on your specific needs, such as whether the data should be private to your
application or accessible to other applications (and the user) and how much space your data
requires.
</p>

<p>Your data storage options are the following:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="#pref">Shared Preferences</a></dt>
    <dd>Store private primitive data in key-value pairs.</dd>
  <dt><a href="#filesInternal">Internal Storage</a></dt>
    <dd>Store private data on the device memory.</dd>
  <dt><a href="#filesExternal">External Storage</a></dt>
    <dd>Store public data on the shared external storage.</dd>
  <dt><a href="#db">SQLite Databases</a></dt>
    <dd>Store structured data in a private database.</dd>
  <dt><a href="#netw">Network Connection</a></dt>
    <dd>Store data on the web with your own network server.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Android provides a way for you to expose even your private data to other applications
&mdash; with a <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">content
provider</a>. A content provider is an optional component that exposes read/write access to
your application data, subject to whatever restrictions you want to impose. For more information
about using content providers, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">Content Providers</a>
documentation.
</p>




<h2 id="pref">Using Shared Preferences</h2>

<p>The {@link android.content.SharedPreferences} class provides a general framework that allows you
to save and retrieve persistent key-value pairs of primitive data types. You can use {@link
android.content.SharedPreferences} to save any primitive data: booleans, floats, ints, longs, and
strings. This data will persist across user sessions (even if your application is killed).</p>

<div class="sidebox-wrapper">
<div class="sidebox">
<h3>User Preferences</h3>
<p>Shared preferences are not strictly for saving "user preferences," such as what ringtone a
user has chosen. If you're interested in creating user preferences for your application, see {@link
android.preference.PreferenceActivity}, which provides an Activity framework for you to create
user preferences, which will be automatically persisted (using shared preferences).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To get a {@link android.content.SharedPreferences} object for your application, use one of
two methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>{@link android.content.Context#getSharedPreferences(String,int)
getSharedPreferences()} - Use this if you need multiple preferences files identified by name,
which you specify with the first parameter.</li>
  <li>{@link android.app.Activity#getPreferences(int) getPreferences()} - Use this if you need
only one preferences file for your Activity. Because this will be the only preferences file
for your Activity, you don't supply a name.</li>
</ul>

<p>To write values:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Call {@link android.content.SharedPreferences#edit()} to get a {@link
android.content.SharedPreferences.Editor}.</li>
  <li>Add values with methods such as {@link
android.content.SharedPreferences.Editor#putBoolean(String,boolean) putBoolean()} and {@link
android.content.SharedPreferences.Editor#putString(String,String) putString()}.</li>
  <li>Commit the new values with {@link android.content.SharedPreferences.Editor#commit()}</li>
</ol>

<p>To read values, use {@link android.content.SharedPreferences} methods such as {@link
android.content.SharedPreferences#getBoolean(String,boolean) getBoolean()} and {@link
android.content.SharedPreferences#getString(String,String) getString()}.</p>

<p>
Here is an example that saves a preference for silent keypress mode in a
calculator:
</p>

<pre>
public class Calc extends Activity {
    public static final String PREFS_NAME = "MyPrefsFile";

    &#64;Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle state){
       super.onCreate(state);
       . . .

page.title=Data Storage
@jd:body

<p>
A typical desktop operating system provides a common file system that any
application can use to store files that can be read by other
applications (perhaps with some access control settings).  Android uses a
different system:  On Android, all application data (including files) are
private to that application.  

<p>
However, Android also provides a standard way for an application to expose 
its private data to other applications &mdash; through a content providers.
A content provider is an 
optional component of an application that exposes read/write access to the 
application's data, subject to whatever restrictions it might impose.  
Content providers implement a standard syntax for requesting and modifying
data, and a standard mechanism for reading the returned data.  Android supplies 
a number of content providers for standard data types, such as image, audio, 
and video files and personal contact information.  For more information on 
using content providers, see a separate document,
<a href="{@docRoot}devel/data/contentproviders.html">Content Providers</a>.
 
<p>
Whether or not you want to export your application's data to others,
you need a way to store it.  Android provides the following four mechanisms
for storing and retrieving data:

<dl>
<dd><a href="#pref">Preferences</a>
<dd><a href="#files">Files</a>
<dd><a href="#db">Databases</a>
<dd><a href="#netw">Network</a>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="pref"></a><b>Preferences</b></dt>
<dd>A lightweight mechanism to store and retrieve key-value pairs of primitive 
data types.  It is typically used to store application preferences, such as a 
default greeting or a text font to be loaded whenever the application is started. Call 
<code>{@link android.content.Context#getSharedPreferences(java.lang.String,int)
Context.getSharedPreferences()}</code> to read and write values.  Assign a name to 
your set of preferences if you want to share them with other components in the same 
application, or use <code>{@link android.app.Activity#getPreferences(int) 
Activity.getPreferences()}</code> with no name to keep them private to the calling
activity.  You cannot share preferences across applications (except by using a 
content provider). 

<p>
Here is an example of setting user preferences for silent keypress mode for a 
calculator:

<pre>
import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.SharedPreferences;

public class Calc extends Activity {
public static final String PREFS_NAME = "MyPrefsFile";
    . . .      

    &#64;Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle state){         
       super.onCreate(state);
    
    . . .
    
>>>>>>> 54b6cfa... Initial Contribution
       // Restore preferences
       SharedPreferences settings = getSharedPreferences(PREFS_NAME, 0);
       boolean silent = settings.getBoolean("silentMode", false);
       setSilent(silent);
    }
<<<<<<< HEAD

    &#64;Override
    protected void onStop(){
       super.onStop();

      // We need an Editor object to make preference changes.
      // All objects are from android.context.Context
=======
    
    &#64;Override
    protected void onStop(){
       super.onStop();
    
      // Save user preferences. We need an Editor object to
      // make changes. All objects are from android.context.Context
>>>>>>> 54b6cfa... Initial Contribution
      SharedPreferences settings = getSharedPreferences(PREFS_NAME, 0);
      SharedPreferences.Editor editor = settings.edit();
      editor.putBoolean("silentMode", mSilentMode);

<<<<<<< HEAD
      // Commit the edits!
      editor.commit();
    }
}
</pre>




<a name="files"></a>
<h2 id="filesInternal">Using the Internal Storage</h2>

<p>You can save files directly on the device's internal storage. By default, files saved
to the internal storage are private to your application and other applications cannot access
them (nor can the user). When the user uninstalls your application, these files are removed.</p>

<p>To create and write a private file to the internal storage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Call {@link android.content.Context#openFileOutput(String,int) openFileOutput()} with the
name of the file and the operating mode. This returns a {@link java.io.FileOutputStream}.</li>
  <li>Write to the file with {@link java.io.FileOutputStream#write(byte[]) write()}.</li>
  <li>Close the stream with {@link java.io.FileOutputStream#close()}.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
String FILENAME = "hello_file";
String string = "hello world!";

FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
fos.write(string.getBytes());
fos.close();
</pre>

<p>{@link android.content.Context#MODE_PRIVATE} will create the file (or replace a file of
the same name) and make it private to your application. Other modes available are: {@link
android.content.Context#MODE_APPEND}, {@link
android.content.Context#MODE_WORLD_READABLE}, and {@link
android.content.Context#MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE}.</p>

<p>To read a file from internal storage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Call {@link android.content.Context#openFileInput openFileInput()} and pass it the
name of the file to read. This returns a {@link java.io.FileInputStream}.</li>
  <li>Read bytes from the file with {@link java.io.FileInputStream#read(byte[],int,int)
read()}.</li>
  <li>Then close the stream with  {@link java.io.FileInputStream#close()}.</li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to save a static file in your application at
compile time, save the file in your project <code>res/raw/</code> directory. You can open it with
{@link android.content.res.Resources#openRawResource(int) openRawResource()}, passing the {@code
R.raw.<em>&lt;filename&gt;</em>} resource ID. This method returns an {@link java.io.InputStream}
that you can use to read the file (but you cannot write to the original file).
</p>


<h3 id="InternalCache">Saving cache files</h3>

<p>If you'd like to cache some data, rather than store it persistently, you should use {@link
android.content.Context#getCacheDir()} to open a {@link
java.io.File} that represents the internal directory where your application should save
temporary cache files.</p>

<p>When the device is
low on internal storage space, Android may delete these cache files to recover space. However, you
should not rely on the system to clean up these files for you. You should always maintain the cache
files yourself and stay within a reasonable limit of space consumed, such as 1MB. When the user
uninstalls your application, these files are removed.</p>


<h3 id="InternalMethods">Other useful methods</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>{@link android.content.Context#getFilesDir()}</dt>
    <dd>Gets the absolute path to the filesystem directory where your internal files are saved.</dd>
  <dt>{@link android.content.Context#getDir(String,int) getDir()}</dt>
    <dd>Creates (or opens an existing) directory within your internal storage space.</dd>
  <dt>{@link android.content.Context#deleteFile(String) deleteFile()}</dt>
    <dd>Deletes a file saved on the internal storage.</dd>
  <dt>{@link android.content.Context#fileList()}</dt>
    <dd>Returns an array of files currently saved by your application.</dd>
</dl>




<h2 id="filesExternal">Using the External Storage</h2>

<p>Every Android-compatible device supports a shared "external storage" that you can use to
save files. This can be a removable storage media (such as an SD card) or an internal
(non-removable) storage. Files saved to the external storage are world-readable and can
be modified by the user when they enable USB mass storage to transfer files on a computer.</p>

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> External files can disappear if the user mounts the
external storage on a computer or removes the media, and there's no security enforced upon files you
save to the external storage. All applications can read and write files placed on the external
storage and the user can remove them.</p>


<h3 id="MediaAvail">Checking media availability</h3>

<p>Before you do any work with the external storage, you should always call {@link
android.os.Environment#getExternalStorageState()} to check whether the media is available. The
media might be mounted to a computer, missing, read-only, or in some other state. For example,
here's how you can check the availability:</p>

<pre>
boolean mExternalStorageAvailable = false;
boolean mExternalStorageWriteable = false;
String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState();

if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) {
    // We can read and write the media
    mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = true;
} else if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY.equals(state)) {
    // We can only read the media
    mExternalStorageAvailable = true;
    mExternalStorageWriteable = false;
} else {
    // Something else is wrong. It may be one of many other states, but all we need
    //  to know is we can neither read nor write
    mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = false;
}
</pre>

<p>This example checks whether the external storage is available to read and write. The
{@link android.os.Environment#getExternalStorageState()} method returns other states that you
might want to check, such as whether the media is being shared (connected to a computer), is missing
entirely, has been removed badly, etc. You can use these to notify the user with more information
when your application needs to access the media.</p>


<h3 id="AccessingExtFiles">Accessing files on external storage</h3>

<p>If you're using API Level 8 or greater, use {@link
android.content.Context#getExternalFilesDir(String) getExternalFilesDir()} to open a {@link
java.io.File} that represents the external storage directory where you should save your
files. This method takes a <code>type</code> parameter that specifies the type of subdirectory you
want, such as {@link android.os.Environment#DIRECTORY_MUSIC} and
{@link android.os.Environment#DIRECTORY_RINGTONES} (pass <code>null</code> to receive
the root of your application's file directory). This method will create the
appropriate directory if necessary. By specifying the type of directory, you
ensure that the Android's media scanner will properly categorize your files in the system (for
example, ringtones are identified as ringtones and not music). If the user uninstalls your
application, this directory and all its contents will be deleted.</p>

<p>If you're using API Level 7 or lower, use {@link
android.os.Environment#getExternalStorageDirectory()}, to open a {@link
java.io.File} representing the root of the external storage. You should then write your data in the
following directory:</p>
<pre class="no-pretty-print classic">
/Android/data/<em>&lt;package_name&gt;</em>/files/
</pre>
<p>The {@code <em>&lt;package_name&gt;</em>} is your Java-style package name, such as "{@code
com.example.android.app}". If the user's device is running API Level 8 or greater and they
uninstall your application, this directory and all its contents will be deleted.</p>


<div class="sidebox-wrapper" style="margin-top:3em">
<div class="sidebox">

<h4>Hiding your files from the Media Scanner</h4>

<p>Include an empty file named {@code .nomedia} in your external files directory (note the dot
prefix in the filename). This will prevent Android's media scanner from reading your media
files and including them in apps like Gallery or Music.</p>

</div>
</div>


<h3 id="SavingSharedFiles">Saving files that should be shared</h3>

<p>If you want to save files that are not specific to your application and that should <em>not</em>
be deleted when your application is uninstalled, save them to one of the public directories on the
external storage. These directories lay at the root of the external storage, such as {@code
Music/}, {@code Pictures/}, {@code Ringtones/}, and others.</p>

<p>In API Level 8 or greater, use {@link
android.os.Environment#getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(String)
getExternalStoragePublicDirectory()}, passing it the type of public directory you want, such as
{@link android.os.Environment#DIRECTORY_MUSIC}, {@link android.os.Environment#DIRECTORY_PICTURES},
{@link android.os.Environment#DIRECTORY_RINGTONES}, or others. This method will create the
appropriate directory if necessary.</p>

<p>If you're using API Level 7 or lower, use {@link
android.os.Environment#getExternalStorageDirectory()} to open a {@link java.io.File} that represents
the root of the external storage, then save your shared files in one of the following
directories:</p>

<ul class="nolist"></li>
  <li><code>Music/</code> - Media scanner classifies all media found here as user music.</li>
  <li><code>Podcasts/</code> - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a podcast.</li>
  <li><code>Ringtones/ </code> - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a ringtone.</li>
  <li><code>Alarms/</code> - Media scanner classifies all media found here as an alarm sound.</li>
  <li><code>Notifications/</code> - Media scanner classifies all media found here as a notification
sound.</li>
  <li><code>Pictures/</code> - All photos (excluding those taken with the camera).</li>
  <li><code>Movies/</code> - All movies (excluding those taken with the camcorder).</li>
  <li><code>Download/</code> - Miscellaneous downloads.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="ExternalCache">Saving cache files</h3>

<p>If you're using API Level 8 or greater, use {@link
android.content.Context#getExternalCacheDir()} to open a {@link java.io.File} that represents the
external storage directory where you should save cache files. If the user uninstalls your
application, these files will be automatically deleted. However, during the life of your
application, you should manage these cache files and remove those that aren't needed in order to
preserve file space.</p>

<p>If you're using API Level 7 or lower, use {@link
android.os.Environment#getExternalStorageDirectory()} to open a {@link java.io.File} that represents
the root of the external storage, then write your cache data in the following directory:</p>
<pre class="no-pretty-print classic">
/Android/data/<em>&lt;package_name&gt;</em>/cache/
</pre>
<p>The {@code <em>&lt;package_name&gt;</em>} is your Java-style package name, such as "{@code
com.example.android.app}".</p>



<h2 id="db">Using Databases</h2>

<p>Android provides full support for <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> databases.
Any databases you create will be accessible by name to any
class in the application, but not outside the application.</p>

<p>The recommended method to create a new SQLite database is to create a subclass of {@link
android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper} and override the {@link
android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper#onCreate(SQLiteDatabase) onCreate()} method, in which you
can execute a SQLite command to create tables in the database. For example:</p>

<pre>
public class DictionaryOpenHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {

    private static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 2;
    private static final String DICTIONARY_TABLE_NAME = "dictionary";
    private static final String DICTIONARY_TABLE_CREATE =
                "CREATE TABLE " + DICTIONARY_TABLE_NAME + " (" +
                KEY_WORD + " TEXT, " +
                KEY_DEFINITION + " TEXT);";

    DictionaryOpenHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }

    &#64;Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
        db.execSQL(DICTIONARY_TABLE_CREATE);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>You can then get an instance of your {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper}
implementation using the constructor you've defined. To write to and read from the database, call
{@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper#getWritableDatabase()} and {@link
android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper#getReadableDatabase()}, respectively. These both return a
{@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase} object that represents the database and
provides methods for SQLite operations.</p>

<div class="sidebox-wrapper">
<div class="sidebox">
<p>Android does not impose any limitations beyond the standard SQLite concepts. We do recommend
including an autoincrement value key field that can be used as a unique ID to
quickly find a record.  This is not required for private data, but if you
implement a <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">content provider</a>,
you must include a unique ID using the {@link android.provider.BaseColumns#_ID BaseColumns._ID}
constant.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>You can execute SQLite queries using the {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase}
{@link
android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase#query(boolean,String,String[],String,String[],String,String,String,String)
query()} methods, which accept various query parameters, such as the table to query,
the projection, selection, columns, grouping, and others. For complex queries, such as
those that require column aliases, you should use
{@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteQueryBuilder}, which provides
several convienent methods for building queries.</p>

<p>Every SQLite query will return a {@link android.database.Cursor} that points to all the rows
found by the query. The {@link android.database.Cursor} is always the mechanism with which
you can navigate results from a database query and read rows and columns.</p>

<p>For sample apps that demonstrate how to use SQLite databases in Android, see the
<a href="{@docRoot}resources/samples/NotePad/index.html">Note Pad</a> and
<a href="{@docRoot}resources/samples/SearchableDictionary/index.html">Searchable Dictionary</a>
applications.</p>


<h3 id="dbDebugging">Database debugging</h3>

<p>The Android SDK includes a {@code sqlite3} database tool that allows you to browse
table contents, run SQL commands, and perform other useful functions on SQLite
databases.  See <a href="{@docRoot}tools/help/adb.html#sqlite">Examining sqlite3
databases from a remote shell</a> to learn how to run this tool.
</p>





<h2 id="netw">Using a Network Connection</h2>

<!-- TODO MAKE THIS USEFUL!! -->

<p>You can use the network (when it's available) to store and retrieve data on your own web-based
services. To do network operations, use classes in the following packages:</p>

<ul class="no-style">
  <li><code>{@link java.net java.net.*}</code></li>
  <li><code>{@link android.net android.net.*}</code></li>
</ul>
=======
      // Don't forget to commit your edits!!!
      editor.commit();
    }
}
</pre></dd>

<p>
<dt><a name="files"></a><b>Files</b></dt>
<dd>You can store files directly on the mobile device or on a removable 
storage medium.  By default, other applications cannot access these files.

<p>
To read data from a file, call {@link android.content.Context#openFileInput 
Context.openFileInput()} and pass it the local name and path of the file.  
It returns a standard Java {@link java.io.FileInputStream} object.  To write 
to a file, call {@link android.content.Context#openFileOutput 
Context.openFileOutput()} with the name and path.  It returns a {@link 
java.io.FileOutputStream} object.  Calling these methods with name and path 
strings from another application will not work; you can only access local 
files.

<p>
If you have a static file to package with your application at compile time, 
you can save the file in your project in <code>res/raw/<em>myDataFile</em></code>, 
and then open it with {@link
android.content.res.Resources#openRawResource(int) Resources.openRawResource
(R.raw.<em>myDataFile</em>)}.  It returns an {@link java.io.InputStream}
object that you can use to read from the file.
</dd>

<dt><a name="db"></a><b>Databases</b></dt>
<dd>The Android API contains support for creating and using SQLite databases. 
Each database is private to the application that creates it.

<p>
The {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase} object represents a database
and has methods for interacting with it &mdash; making queries and managing the
data.  To create the database, call <code>{@link 
android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase#create SQLiteDatabase.create()}</code> 
and also subclass {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper}.  

<p>
As part of its support for the SQLite database system, Android exposes 
database management functions that let you store complex collections of data 
wrapped into useful objects.  For example, Android defines a data type 
for contact information; it consists of many fields including a first and last 
name (strings), an address and phone numbers (also strings), a photo (bitmap
image), and much other information describing a person. 

<p>
Android ships with the sqlite3 database tool, which enables you to browse
table contents, run SQL commands, and perform other useful functions on SQLite
databases.  See <a href="{@docRoot}reference/adb.html#sqlite">Examine databases 
(sqlite3)</a> to learn how to run this program.

<p>
All databases, SQLite and others, are stored on the device in 
<code>/data/data/<em>package_name</em>/databases</code>.

<p>
Discussion of how many tables to create, what fields they contain, and how
they are linked, is beyond the scope of this note, but Android does not
impose any limitations beyond the standard SQLite concepts.  We do recommend
including an autoincrement value key field that can be used as a unique ID to
quickly find a record.  This is not required for private data, but if you
implement a content provider, you must include such a unique ID field.  See the
<a href="{@docRoot}devel/data/contentproviders.html">Content Providers</a>
document for more information on this field and the NotePadProvider class 
in the NotePad sample code for an example of creating and populating a 
new database.  Any databases you create will be accessible by name to any other 
class in the application, but not outside the application.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="netw"></a><b>Network</b></dt>
<dd>You can also use the network to store and retrieve data (when it's available).
To do network operations, use the classes in the following packages:

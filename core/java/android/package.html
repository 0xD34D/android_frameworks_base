<p>Contains resource classes used by applications included in the platform and defines application
permissions for system features.</p>

<p>You can use some resources directly from these {@link android.R} classes in your own
applications, but you should generally use only resources that you've provided directly in your
application, in order to provide a cohesive application package that has no external dependencies.
In particular, you should not use drawable resources from the {@code android} package, because they
may change between platform versions, causing unforeseen conflicts with your design. Typically,
{@link android.R.style styles} are the only resources you should use directly from these
resources.</p>

<p>For information about using resources, see the <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/resources/index.html">Application Resources</a> developer guide.</p>

Contains the resource classes used by standard Android applications.
<p>
This package contains the resource classes that Android defines to be used in 
Android applications. Third party developers can use many of them also for their applications.
To learn more about how to use these classes, and what a 
resource is, see <a href="{@docRoot}devel/resources-i18n.html">Resources</a>.
